<ONE PARA INTRO - THE GAME, THE OBJECTIVE, THE MAJOR ACTIVITY>

In Poppy Runner you will be traversing through the city avoiding (or killing) cops, taking poppy flowers, converting 
them to goods, and delivering for money. Flowers mean goods, goods mean money, and money means POWER! The goal of this game is to obtain 
the most money in a certain amounnt of time. Utilize running, jumping, and sliding to move around quickly. 


KEY FEATURES LIST:

In this game you can convert poppy flowers into the goods in fast-paced gameplay and within a certain time 

You can sprint, attack, double jump or slide under various obstacles to overcome a multitude of things in your way, such as police, vehicles, and more. 

Another thing you can do in this game is sell off goods for money to various clients as flower is power and so as money. 

The placement of poppy flowers, buildings, and clients are procedurally randomized
